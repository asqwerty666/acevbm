# ACEVBM

### Why this?

I need my own VBM pipeline because,

- For some reason FSLVBM doesn't like some of my projects MRI
- Maybe I can integrate it into the main NI analysis pipeline
- I don't like/understand other people pipelines

### Dependencies

- SLURM :-D
- FSL
- ANTs
- Perl modules
  - File::Temp
  - File::Find::Rule
  - Cwd
  - File::Basename
